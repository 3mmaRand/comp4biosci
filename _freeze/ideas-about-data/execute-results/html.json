Data consists of:\n\n-   Variables — the properties or characteristics that we measure or\n    record, and\n-   Observations — the individual cases or items that those variables\n    describe.\n\nA helpful and common way to organise data is in a table, where each\ncolumn represents a variable and each row represents one observation.\nEvery value in a row related to a single observation such as a person,\nplant, or sample. We call data in this format \"tidy\".\n\nWe can describe variables in two main ways:\n\n-   By their role in the analysis, that is, whether they are independent\n    (explanatory) or dependent (response) variables.\n\n-   By the type of values they take and how often those values occur.\n\nThe second aspect — what kinds of values a variable can have and how\ncommon each one is — is called the variable’s distribution. The way we\nsummarise, visualise, and analyse a variable depends on both its role\nand its distribution.\n\n## Roles of variables in analysis\n\nWhen we do research, we typically have variables that we choose or set\nand variables that we measure. The variables we choose or set are called\nindependent or explanatory variables. The variables we measure are\ncalled dependent or response variables. For example, we might measure\nthe concentration of enzymes and hormones in blood samples of\nindividuals with different genotypes. The genotype acts as the\nexplanatory variable and the blood measurements are response. We would\nbe interested in whether the blood measures differ between genotypes.\n\n## Distributions\n\nAny variable has a *distribution* which describes the values the\nvariable can take and the chance of them occurring. The distribution is\na function (relationship) which captures how the values are mapped to\nthe probability of them occurring. A distribution has a general type,\ngiven by the function and is further tuned by the *parameters* in the\nfunction. For example, variables like height, length, concentration,\nmass and intensity follow a *normal distribution* also know as the\nbell-shaped curve so that they look similar. However, they have\ndifferent means and standard deviations. The mean and the standard\ndeviation are the parameters of the normal distribution.\n\nAn important distinction is between **discrete** and **continuous**\ntypes of data. Continuous variables are measurements that can take *any*\nvalue in their range. Because there an infinite number of possible\nvalues within within the range, the probability of a continuous variable\ntaking exactly one specific value is zero. Instead, we talk about the\nprobability that the value is less than a particular value, greater than\na particular value or between two values. For example, we might say the\nprobability a person's height is greater than 170cm is 0.3\n(@fig-distrib-contin). In contrast, discrete variables can take only\nspecific values often counts or categories. For example, the number of\nleaves on a plant or the number of times a gene is expressed. In this\ncase, it's meaningful to talk about the probability of a single value.\nEach possible value has its own individual probability, and the sum of\nall those probabilities equals 1 (@fig-distrib-discrete).\n\n::: {#fig-distrib-contin}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ideas-about-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**An example of a distribution for a continuous variable.** The values a\ncontinuous variable can take are on the horizontal axis. Continuous\nvariables have a smooth distribution and the probability of getting a\nparticular value or less is given by the area under the curve before\nthat value. This example is the Normal distribution.\n:::\n\n::: {#fig-distrib-discrete}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ideas-about-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**An example of a distribution for a discrete variable.** A discrete\nvariable has a stepped distribution and the probability of getting\nexactly a particular is given by the area of the bar at that value. This\nexample is the Poisson distribution.\n:::\n\nThis difference between continuous and discrete variables affects how we\nanalyse and visualise data. Discrete data is often shown using bar plots\nand summarised with modes of medians, while continuous data is\nrepresented using histograms or density plots and summarised with means\nand standard deviations.\n\n## Summarising data\n\nWe summarise data by giving a measure of *central tendency* and a\nmeasure of *dispersion*. A measure of central tendency is a single value\nthat represents the middle or centre of a variable's distribution. The\nthree most common measures are:\n\n-   the mean, or more accurately, the arithmetic mean,\n    $\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum{x}}{n}$\n\n-   the median: the middle value for a variable with values arranged in\n    order of magnitude\n\n-   the mode: the most frequent value in the variable.\n\nMeasures of dispersion describe the spread of values around the centre\nand indicate how much variability there is in the variable. The most\ncommon measures of dispersion are:\n\n-   the range: the difference between the maximum value and the minimum\n    value in a variable\n\n-   the interquartile range: two values, the first quartile and the\n    third quartile. The first quartile is half way between the median\n    value and the lowest value when the values are arranged in order and\n    the third quartile is halfway between the median value and the\n    highest value\n\n-   the variance: the average of the squared differences between each\n    value and the variable's mean,\n    $s^2 = \\frac{(\\sum{x - \\bar{x})^2}}{n - 1}$\n\n-   the standard deviation: the square root of the variance.\n\n## Discrete data\n\nDiscrete variables can take only specific values and can be categories,\nlike genotype, or counts, like the number of petals.\n\n### Categories: Nominal and Ordinal\n\nCategorical data can be nominal or ordinal depending on whether the\ncategories are are ordered. Nominal variables have no particular order,\nfor example, the eye colour of Drosophila or the species of bird. When\nsummarising data on bird species, it wouldn't matter in what order the\ninformation was given or plotted. Ordinal variables have an order. The\nLikert scale [@likert1932] used in questionnaires is one example. The\npossible responses are Strongly agree, Agree, Disagree and Strongly\ndisagree; these have an order that you would use when plotting them\n(@fig-categories).\n\n\n::: {#fig-categories layout-nrow=\"1\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ideas-about-data_files/figure-html/fig-categ-bird-1.png){#fig-categ-bird width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ideas-about-data_files/figure-html/fig-categ-likert-1.png){#fig-categ-likert width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Categorical data can be nominal or ordinal.** Nominal variables like \nspecies (@fig-categ-bird) have no particular order whilst ordinal variables\nlike those on the Likert scale [@likert1932] have an order.\n\n:::\n\nThe most appropriate way to summarise nominal or ordinal data is to\nreport the mode (most frequent value) or tabulate the number of each\nvalue (@tbl-likert).\n\n\n::: {#tbl-likert .cell tbl-cap='Frequency of responses to a Likert scale question.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Response </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Frequency </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Strongly agree </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 10 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Agree </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 14 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Disagree </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Strongly disagree </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Counts\n\nCounts are one of the most common data types. They are quantitative but\ndiscrete because they can take only specific values. Counts tend to\nfollow a distribution called the Poisson distribution meaning that there\nis an expected number of zeros, ones and twos etc that appear. This is\ntrue no matter what you count. The distribution of counts is not\nsymmetrical when the average count is low. For example, the number of \ngroundsel plants in one hundred 1 metre x 1 metre square \nquadrats[^ideas_about_data-1] is likely in the range of 0 to 3 plants \nper quadrat. This distribution is skewed to the right, meaning it has a\ntail to the right. A mean is not usually the best way to summarise a \nset of counts because it is dragged up by the few quadrats with more \nthan 2 plants (@fig-counts).  Instead, the median better represents the \nmiddle of the distribution. The median is the middle value when the \nvalues are arranged in order. The interquartile range (IQR) indicates \nthe spread in the data. The lower quartile is half way between the \nlowest value and the middle value and the upper quartile is half way \nbetween the middle value and the highest value.\n\n\n[^ideas_about_data-1]: A quadrat is a frame used in ecology to outline a\n    standard unit of area for study of the distribution of plant species\n    over a wider are. Typically, quadrats are placed randomly over the\n    area and the number of individuals in each quadrat is recorded.\n\n\n::: {#fig-counts}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ideas-about-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**The number of groundsel plants in one hundred 1 metre x 1 metre square \nquadrats is a count and follows a Poisson distribution.** The mean of \n0.73 groundsel plants per quadrat does not really reflect that the \nmajority of quadrats contained no plants! The average is being dragged up by \nthe few quadrats containing 3 plants. The median is 0.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Continuous data\n\nContinuous variables are measurements that can take *any* value in their\nrange so there are an infinite number of possible values. The values\nhave decimal places. Variables like the length and mass of an organism,\nthe volume and optical density of a solution, or the colour intensity of\nan image are continuous. Many response variables are continuous but\ncontinuous variables can also be explanatory. A large number of\ncontinuous variables follow the normal distribution.\n\n### The normal distribution\n\nFor example, a variable like human height has values with decimal places\nwhich follow a normal distribution also known as the Gaussian\ndistribution or the bell-shaped curve. Values of 1.65 metres occur more\noften than values of 2 metres and values of 3 metres never occur\n(@fig-normal-distribtion).\n\n::: {#fig-normal-distribtion}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ideas-about-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Human height follows a normal distribution.**\n\n:::\n\nThe mean and standard deviation are the best way to summarise a normally\ndistributed variable.\n\n\n\n## Theory and practice\n\nThe distinction between continuous and discrete values is clear in\ntheory but in practice, the actual values you have may differ from the\nexpected distribution for a particular variable. For example, we would\nexpect the mass of cats to be continuous because any value in the range\nis possible. However, if our scales only measure to the nearest\nkilogram, then the values become discrete because the only the values\npossible are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. The gap between values, 1kg, is\nbig compared to the range of values we expect (@fig-contin-is-discrete).\n\n::: {#fig-contin-is-discrete}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ideas-about-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**The mass of cats in kilograms.** Theoretically mass is a continuous variable\n(left). However if we measure only to the nearest kilogram, then mass \nbecomes discrete because cats only weigh few kilograms so 1kg covers a \nlarge chunk of the range (right).\n:::\n\n\n\nIn contrast, the number of hairs on a human head ranges from about\n80,000 to 150,000 so the difference between having 100,203 hairs and\n100,204 hairs is so tiny the variable is practically continuous\n(@fig-discrete-is-contin).\n\n::: {#fig-discrete-is-contin}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ideas-about-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**The number of hairs on a human head**. As a count, this is a discrete \nvariable. However. one increment is a tiny proportion of the range \nof values so the number of hairs is practically continuous.\n\n:::\n\nA rule of thumb is that if the mean count is above about 100, then the\ndistribution of counts closely matches the normal distribution.\n\n## Summary\n\n1.  Data: Data consists of variables (properties measured or recorded)\n    and observations (individual things with those properties). Data is\n    commonly organised with variables in columns and observations in\n    rows.\n\n2.  Roles of Variables in Analysis: Variables in research can be\n    independent or explanatory variables (chosen or set by researchers)\n    and dependent or response variables (measured by researchers).\n\n3.  Distributions: A variable's distribution describes the types of\n    values it can take and the likelihood of each value occurring.\n    Variables can be classified as discrete (specific values) or\n    continuous (any value within a range). The shape of a distribution\n    is determined by parameters.\n\n4.  Discrete Data: Discrete variables can be categories or counts.\n    Categorical data can be nominal (no order) or ordinal (ordered) and\n    are best summarised with the mode or a table. Counts are often best\n    summarised by the median and interquartile range.\n\n5.  Continuous Data: Continuous variables can take any value within a\n    range. The normal distribution is the most common continuous\n    distribution and is best summarised with the mean and standard\n    deviation.\n\n6.  Theory and Practice: While the theoretical distinction between\n    continuous and discrete values is clear, the actual values obtained\n    in practice may deviate from the expected distribution. Measurement\n    precision and range affect whether a variable is considered\n    continuous or discrete. A rule of thumb suggests that if the mean\n    count is above approximately 100, the distribution of counts\n    approximates a normal distribution.\n",
