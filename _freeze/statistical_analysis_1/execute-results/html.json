This page is compete but needs final proof reading.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## What this section covers\n\nThis section introduces the fundamentals of **Statistical Inference**,\nthe process of drawing conclusions about a population's characteristics\nbased on sample data. In this first course, we focus on the\n**frequentist (or classical) approach** to statistical inference, which\nis the most commonly taught method in introductory statistics courses.\n\n### Why do we need statistical inference?\n\nIn biosciences - and many other fields - we need statistical inference\nbecause it is usually impossible to study and measure entire\npopulations. Instead, we need to take a random sample to draw\nconclusions about the population of interest. Statistical inference\nprovides the tools to make these conclusions reliably, accounting for\nthe variability and uncertainty inherent in sampling.\n\n### What tools will we cover?\n\nWe begin by explaining the logic of **hypothesis testing** and its role\nin making statistical inferences. Following this, we explore\n**confidence intervals** and provide an introduction to **statistical\nmodels**, with a particular focus on **linear models**.\n\nThe remaining chapters delve into **regression**, ***t*-tests**, and\n**ANOVA**, which are special cases of a broader statistical framework\nknown as the **General Linear Model (GLM)**. While *t*-tests and ANOVA\nare often taught using the `t.test()` and `aov()` functions in R,\nrespectively, this book approaches them using the `lm()` function. This\nemphasizes their shared foundation within the GLM framework and helps\nyou understand that regression, *t*-tests, and ANOVA are all variations\nof the same underlying model.\n\nBy learning these concepts through the `lm()` function, you will become\nfamiliar with the terminology and language of statistical modelling.\nThis approach also makes it easier to build upon your knowledge, as the\noutput of `lm()` is representative of the structure and results of\nstatistical modelling functions in R more broadly.\n\nThe GLM framework makes some assumptions about the data to calculate \nprobabilities. These are known as parametric assumptions and the GLM \nis a parametric test. As we apply each test we will check the \nassumptions are met. You learn how to apply non-paramtric tests when\nthe parametric assumptions are not met. These are applied with \n`wilcox.test()` and `kruskal.test()`\n",
