This page is a dumping ground for ideas. Sections maybe missing, or contain a list of points to include.\n:::\n\n\n\n## What this section covers\n\nThis chapter focuses on the digital interpretation, annotation, and\nanalysis of gel-based experimental data, including agarose gels,\npolyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE), and Western blots. It covers the key\nsteps and tools for transforming gel images into meaningful,\nquantifiable results suitable for research reporting and publication.\n\n### What is gel data?\n\nGel data refers to the visual representation of molecular separation\nachieved through gel electrophoresis. The molecules can be DNA,\nRNA, or proteins, and the gel serves as a medium to separate them based \non size, charge, or other properties. \n\nThis data is typically captured as digital images of gels. A gels can \ntells:\n\n-   whether a molecule is present or absent\n-   the size of the molecule using molecular weight \n    or DNA ladders as references\n-   the relative abundance of the molecule\n\n\nAgarose gel electrophoresis is used to separate DNA fragments by size.\nIt is commonly to verify whether a PCR product is present.\n\nSDS-PAGE using a polyacrylamide gel separates proteins based on size. \nBy comparing to ladder of known sizes, the size of the proteins can be \nestimated. An SDS-PAGE will shows all the proteins in the sample. \n \nWestern blotting is used to identify specific proteins in an SDS-PAGE \ngel using antibodies. The proteins are transferred from the gel to a\nmembrane, where they can be probed with antibodies that bind to the \ntarget protein.\n\n\n### What methods will we cover?\n\nImporting gel images\n\nCropping, contrast adjustment, and rotation (without \naltering data integrity)\n\nManual and automated band detection\n\nMeasuring migration distances\n\nCalculating Rf values and estimating molecular weights\n\nBand intensity measurement \n\nAnnotation to label lanes, bands, and markers for publication\n\n\n",
