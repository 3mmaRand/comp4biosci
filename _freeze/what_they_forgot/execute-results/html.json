This page is a first draft but should be readable.\n:::\n\n## Why \"What they forgot\"?\n\nMost students grew up with the presence of digital technology and are\nthought to be comfortable with, and fluent in, technology. But for many,\nthis fluency is with using tablets and smart phones and these are\ndifferent to computers. Several studies have shown that the increased\nreliance on of tablets and smartphones makes people highly proficient at\nonline communication but hampers the development of other computing\nskills [@drossel2017;\n@australiancurriculumassessmentandreportingNationalAssessmentProgram2014].\n\nThis chapter tries to teach the computer skills that you might have\nmissed if you have used mainly the mobile devices. I focus on the\nknowledge gaps that often appear when people are learning computational\ndata analysis. Primarily these are to do with finding and organising\ntheir files and folders in the file systems.\n\nIf you often use a computer for tasks like organising files and writing\ndocuments and spreadsheets much of this chapter might be familiar.\nHowever, if you have mainly used your mobile phone and tablets to access\nthe internet then reading all of it will be helpful. The first chapter\nbriefly explains why a computer rather than a tablet is most useful for\na science degree and what an operating system is. The second chapter\nsome essential concept for scientific computers: file system\norganisation, file types, working directories and paths. Most people\njoining a bioscience degree programme are not familiar with the concept\nof working directories but will find learning data analysis much easier\nonce they pick up this knowledge.\n",
