This page is a dumping ground for one or more ideas. Sections maybe missing, or in bullet form and code may not be explained.\n:::\n\n## What is a Western Blot?\n\nA Western blot is a laboratory technique used to detect specific\nproteins in a sample. Proteins are isolated from the sample, sorted\nby size using SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a membrane (usually\nnitrocellulose or PVDF). The membrane is incubated with a primary \nantibody that binds to the target protein. A secondary antibody, \nlinked to a detectable enzyme or fluorophore, binds to the primary\nantibody so the protein of interested can be detected. The result is a \nband on the membrane. The molecular weight of a protein can be estimated\nfrom the position of the band on the membrane because the distance \ntravelled by the protein is inversely proportional to the log of the \nmolecular weight. The intensity of the band can also be used to estimate\nthe amount of protein present in the sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Scenario\n\nMacrophages are immune cells that play a key role in the body's defense\nagainst pathogens. They can be activated by various stimuli, including\nbacterial infection. In this experiment, we are interested in the\nproduction of TNF-alpha, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, in response to\nbacterial infection. We will use a Western blot to determine the\n\nMacrophages are treated with one of three treatments: Media, LPS or \nNeonGreen fluorescent *E.coli* Macrophages produce TNF-Î± in response to\nbacterial infection\n\n![Model western blot data containing protein weight markers (lane 1) and\nanti-TNFalpha stained samples for media (in lane 2), LPS-stimulated (in\nlane 3), and E.coli-stimulated (in lane 4)\nsamples.](data-images/western-blot-anti-TNFalpha%20stained-macrophages.png){width=\"200\"}\n\n![A picture of the protein weight markers used in the experiments with\ntheir associated weights in kilodaltons\n(kDa).](data-images/protein-weight-markers.png){width=\"200\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(imager)\n```\n:::\n\n\nUse the **`imager`** package to import your Western blot image.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nblot <- load.image(\"data-images/western-blot-anti-TNFalpha stained-macrophages.png\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(blot)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](molecular-weight-from-western-blot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor a typical blot, y increases downwards, so smaller bands (higher kDa) are higher up.\n\n\nAnnotate the Lanes and Marker Lane\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Number of bands in your marker lane\n# click from the top or gel to the bottom \n# i.e., high MW to low\nmarker_positions <- locator(n = 11)  \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# make sure these are in the same order \n# that you clicked lanes in\n# i.e., high MW to low\n\nmarker_df <- tibble(\n  x = marker_positions$x,\n  y = marker_positions$y,\n  # Replace with your actual marker weights\n  KDa = c(250, 180, 130, 95, 72, 55, 43, 34, 26, 17, 10)  \n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmigration_points <- locator(n = 2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\norigin_y <- migration_points$y[1]\nfront_y <- migration_points$y[2]\ntotal_migration <- abs(front_y - origin_y)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# band positions for each sample: LPS, E.coli\ntnf_positions <- locator(n = 2)  \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntnf_df <- tibble(\n  x = tnf_positions$x,\n  y = tnf_positions$y,\n  distance_migrated = abs(tnf_positions$y - origin_y),\n  Rf = distance_migrated / total_migration\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmarker_df <- marker_df  |> \n  mutate(\n    distance_migrated = abs(y - origin_y),\n    Rf = distance_migrated / total_migration,\n    log_kda = log10(KDa)\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = marker_df, aes(x = Rf, y = log_kda)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE)\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel <- lm(log_kda ~ Rf, data = marker_df)\nsummary(model)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Predict TNF band molecular weight\ntnf_df <- tnf_df  |> \n  mutate(\n    predicted_log_kda = predict(model, newdata = tnf_df),\n    predicted_kda = 10^predicted_log_kda\n  )\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nTNF-alpha has a molecular weight of approximately 17 kDa for the \nmonomeric form and 52 kDa for the homotrimer.
