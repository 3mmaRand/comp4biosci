The expected size of the \n    PCR product is 618 bp. The expectation is that you will\n    see a band of this size for your Pseudomonas putida samples and \n    not for E. coli or the water control\n\n#### Prac 2 Assay the number of bacteria with spot plates\n\n游릴\n\nResponse: Number of bacteria\nTwo Explanatory: \n   soil: contaminated with hexadecane or not\n   temperatuire: 4 degrees or 25 degrees\n\n\n\n#### Prac 3 Design an experiment that uses methods from prac 2\n\n\n### BIO2 Health and disease\n\n#### Prac 1 \n游릴\n#### Prac 2 \n\n#### Prac 3 \n\n\n### BCH\n\n#### Prac 1 \n\n#### Prac 2 \n\n#### Prac 3 \n\n\n### BMS Anitbiotics and antimicrobial resistance\n\n#### Prac 1 \n\n#### Prac 2 \n\n#### Prac 3 \n\n\n## 66I\n\n### Biomedical sciences\n\nflow cytometry to assess the effect of LPS and E. coli on TNFalpha production in macrophages\n\n游릴 SDS-PAGE and western blot to assess TNFalpha production in the whole cell population across the media, LPS, and E. coli stimulated macrophage samples.\n\nassess size of the protein band in comparison to TNFalpha, and the strength of the protein signal in each sample\n\n\n### Biotechnology\n\n\n### Cell biology\n\n\n### Molecular systema\n\n\n### Gene expression and biochemical interactions\n",
