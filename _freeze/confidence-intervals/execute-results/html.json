Confidence intervals are a range of values and\nare a way to quantify the uncertainty in our estimate. When we report a\nmean with its 95% confidence interval we give the mean plus and minus\nsome variation. We are saying that 95% of the time, that range will\ncontain the population mean.\n\nThe confidence interval is calculated from the sample mean and the\nstandard error of the mean. The standard error of the mean is the\nstandard deviation of the [sampling distribution of the\nmean](logic_hyopthesis_testing.html#sampling-distribution-of-the-mean).\n\nTo understand confidence intervals we need to understand some properties\nof the normal distribution.\n\n## The normal distribution\n\nA [distribution](ideas_about_data.html#distributions) describes the\n*values* the variable can take and the *chance* of them occurring. A\ndistribution has a general type, given by the function, and is further\ntuned by the *parameters* in the function. For the normal distribution\nthese parameters are the **mean** and the **standard deviation**. Every\nvariable that follows the normal distribution has the same bell shaped\ncurve and the distributions differ only in their means and/or standard\ndeviations. The mean determines where the centre of the distribution is,\nthe standard deviation determines the spread\n(@fig-normal-distributions).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-normal-distributions  layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](confidence-intervals_files/figure-html/fig-normal-same-mean-1.png){#fig-normal-same-mean width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](confidence-intervals_files/figure-html/fig-normal-same-sd-1.png){#fig-normal-same-sd width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**The normal distribution has two *parameters*: the mean and the \nstandard deviation.**  The mean determines where the centre of the \ndistribution is, the standard deviation determines the spread. @fig-normal-same-mean The distributions have the same mean but \ndifferent standard deviations. @fig-normal-same-sd The distributions \nhave the same standard deviation but different means.\n\n:::\n\n\nWhilst normal distributions vary in the location on the horizontal axis\nand their width, they all share some properties and it is these shared\nproperties that allow the calculation of confidence intervals with some\nstandard formulae. The properties are that a fix percentage of values\nlie between a given number of standard deviations. For example, 68.2%\nvalues lie between plus and minus one standard deviation from the mean\nand 95% values lie between $\\pm$ 1.96 standard deviations. Another way\nof saying this is that there is a 95% chance that a randomly selected\nvalue will lie between $\\pm$ 1.96 standard deviations from the mean.\nThis is illustrated in @fig-norm-dist-properties.\n\n\n::: {#fig-norm-dist-properties layout-ncol=\"1\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](confidence-intervals_files/figure-html/fig-norm-dist-1sd-1.png){#fig-norm-dist-1sd width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](confidence-intervals_files/figure-html/fig-norm-dist-1-96-1.png){#fig-norm-dist-1-96 width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Normal distributions share some properties regardless of the mean and \nstandard deviation.** @fig-norm-dist-1sd 68% of the values are within \none standard deviation of the mean and, @fig-norm-dist-1-96 95% are \nwithin 1.96 standard deviations.\n:::\n\nR has some useful functions associated with distributions, including the\nnormal distribution.\n\n### Distributions: the R functions\n\nFor any distribution, R has four functions:\n\n-   the density function, which gives the *height* of the function at a\n    given value.\n-   the distribution function, which gives the **probability** that a\n    variable takes *a particular value or less*. This is the area under\n    the curve.\n-   the quantile function which is the inverse of the Distribution\n    function, *i.e.*, it returns the value ('quantile') for a given\n    probability.\n-   the random number generating function.\n\nThe functions are named with a letter `d`, `p`, `q` or `r` preceding the\ndistribution name. @tbl-rdistrib shows these four functions for some \ncommon distributions: the normal, binomial, Poisson and *t* \ndistributions.\n\n| Distribution | Density    | Distribution | Quantile   | Random number generating |\n|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Normal       | `dnorm()`  | `pnorm()`    | `qnorm()`  | `rnorm()`                |\n| Binomial     | `dbinom()` | `pbinom()`   | `qbinom()` | `rbinom()`               |\n| Poisson      | `dpois()`  | `ppois()`    | `qpois()`  | `rpois()`                |\n| t            | `dt()`     | `pt()`       | `qt()`     | `rt()`                   |\n\n: R functions that provide values for some example distributions\n{#tbl-rdistrib}\n\n\nThe functions which are of most use to us are those for the normal \ndistribution: `pnorm()` and `qnorm()`. These are illustrated in\n@fig-norm.\n\n::: {#fig-norm layout-ncol=\"1\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](confidence-intervals_files/figure-html/fig-pnorm-1.png){#fig-pnorm width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](confidence-intervals_files/figure-html/fig-qnorm-1.png){#fig-qnorm width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**How the functions for statistical distributions work in R.** \nThe `pnorm()` and `qnorm()` functions return values related to the \nnormal distribution. @fig-pnorm `pnorm()` returns the probability \n(the area under the curve) to the right of a given x-value. @fig-qnorm \n`qnorm()` returns the value along the *x*-axis corresponding to a given \ncumulative probability.\n\n:::\n\nSearching for the manual with `?normal` or any one of the functions\n(`?pnorm`) will bring up a single help page for all four associated\nfunctions.\n\n::: {#fig-manual-page}\n<iframe style=\"height:400px;width:750px;border:2px\" src=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/Normal.html\" title=\"Manual page\">\n\n</iframe>\n\n**The R Manual Page for the normal distribution**  shows the four\nfunctions associated with the normal distribution. The functions are\n`dnorm()`, `pnorm()`, `qnorm()` and `rnorm()`.

Not if you have R!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqnorm(0.975)\n## [1] 1.959964\n```\n:::\n\n\nNotice that it is `qnorm(0.975)` and not `qnorm(0.95)` for a 95%\nconfidence interval. This is because the functions are defined as giving\nthe area under to the curve to the left of the value given. This is \nknown as being \"one-tailed\". To get 0.05 in the *two tails combined*, we\nneed to have 0.025 - half of 0.05 - in *each tail*. The value on the\n*x*-axis that puts 0.025 in the upper tail is 0.975 \n(@fig-qnorm-is-one-tail). If we gave 0.95, we would get the value that \nput 0.05 in one tail and 0.9 in the central area. We want 0.025 in \neach tail, so we need to use 0.975 in `qnorm()`.\n\n::: {#fig-qnorm-is-one-tail}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](confidence-intervals_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**The statistical distributions functions are \"one-tailed\".** \nWhen we give `qnorm()` a probability, returns the value on the *x*-axis \nbelow which that proportion of the distribution lies. For a confidence\ninterval of 95%, we need the values on the *x*-axis that capture the \nmiddle 95% of the normal distribution. This is 0.025 in each tail.\n\n:::\n\n## Confidence intervals on small samples\n\nThe calculation of confidence intervals on small samples is very similar\nbut we use the *t*-distribution rather than the normal distribution. The\nformula is:\n\n$$\n\\bar{x} \\pm t_{[d.f.]} \\times s.e.\n$$ {#eq-ci-small-sample}\n\nThe *t*-distibution is a modified version of the normal distribution and\nwe use it because the sampling distribution of the mean is not quite\nnormal when the sample size is small. The *t*-distribution has an\nadditional parameter called the *degrees of freedom* which is the sample\nsize minus one ($n -1$). Like the normal distribution, the\n*t*-distribution has a mean of zero and is symmetrical. However, The\n*t*-distribution has fatter tails than the normal distribution and this\nmeans that the probability of getting a value in the tails is higher\nthan for the normal distribution. The degrees of freedom determine how\nmuch fatter the tails are. The smaller the sample size, the fatter the\ntails. As the sample size increases, the *t*-distribution becomes more\nand more like the normal distribution.\n\n### What are degrees of freedom?\n\nDegrees of freedom (usually abbreivated *d.f.*) describe how much\nindependent information is available to estimate variability when\ncalculating probabilities. In a population, *all* values are known, so\nno parameters need estimating. In a sample, we estimate parameters such\nas the mean. In estimating a mean, only $n - 1$ values can vary\nindependently because one value is constrained by the sample mean. In\nhypothesis tests and confidence intervals, *d.f.* adjust for uncertainty\nwhen generalizing from a sample to a population, affecting probability\ndistributions like the *t*-distribution. More *d.f.* mean better\nprobability estimates, while fewer *d.f.* reflect greater uncertainty in\nestimating population parameters.\n\n## 🎬 Your turn!\n\nIf you want to code along you will need to start a new [RStudio\nproject](workflow_rstudio.html#rstudio-projects), add a `data-raw`\nfolder and open a new script. You will also need to load the\n**`tidyverse`** package [@tidyverse].\n\n## Large samples\n\nA team of biomedical researchers is studying the concentration of\nCreatine Kinase (CK) in the blood of patients with muscle disorders.\nThey collect a large random sample (n = 100) of blood samples from\npatients and measure the CK concentration in UL^-1^ (units per litre).\n\nThe goal is to estimate the average CK concentration in this patient\npopulation and calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean\nconcentration.
