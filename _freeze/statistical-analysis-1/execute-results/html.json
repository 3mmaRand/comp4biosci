This page is compete but needs final proof reading.\n:::\n\n## What this section covers\n\nThis section introduces the fundamentals of **Statistical Inference**,\nthe process of drawing conclusions about a population's characteristics\nbased on sample data. In this first course, we focus on the\n**frequentist (or classical) approach** to statistical inference, which\nis the most commonly taught method in introductory statistics courses.\n\n### Why do we need statistical inference?\n\nIn biosciences - and many other fields - we need statistical inference\nbecause it is usually impossible to study and measure entire\npopulations. Instead, we need to take a random sample to draw\nconclusions about the population of interest. Statistical inference\nprovides the tools to make these conclusions reliably, accounting for\nthe variability and uncertainty inherent in sampling.\n\n### What tools will we cover?\n\nWe begin by explaining the logic of **hypothesis testing** and its role\nin making statistical inferences. Following this, we explore\n**confidence intervals** and provide an introduction to **statistical\nmodels**, with a particular focus on **linear models**.\n\nThe remaining chapters delve into **regression**, ***t*-tests**, and\n**ANOVA**, which are special cases of a broader statistical framework\nknown as the **General Linear Model (GLM)**. While *t*-tests and ANOVA\nare often taught using the `t.test()` and `aov()` functions in R,\nrespectively, this book approaches them using the `lm()` function. This\nemphasizes their shared foundation within the GLM framework and helps\nyou understand that regression, *t*-tests, and ANOVA are all variations\nof the same underlying model.\n\nBy learning these concepts through the `lm()` function, you will become\nfamiliar with the terminology and language of statistical modelling.\nThis approach also makes it easier to build upon your knowledge, as the\noutput of `lm()` is representative of the structure and results of\nstatistical modelling functions in R more broadly.\n\nThe GLM framework makes some **assumptions** about the data to calculate \nprobabilities. These are known as parametric assumptions and the GLM \nas a **parametric test**. As we apply each test we will check the \nassumptions are met. With each of the parametric methods you learn,\nyou will also learn alternatives for when the assumptions are not met.\nThese are the **Wilcoxon rank sum test** (also known as the \nMann-Whitney), the **Wilcoxon signed rank test**, and the \n**Kruskal-Wallis** test. They are applied with `wilcox.test()` \nand `kruskal.test()`.\n",
