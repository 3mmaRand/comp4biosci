To\nverify the identity of the bacteria within these capsules, primers\nspecific to *Lactobacillus acidophilus* were designed and used in a PCR\nreaction. Three cell extracts were prepared from three bacterial\ncolonies: two isolated from probiotic capsules, and one from *E. coli*,\nwhich was included as a negative control as it is not expected to be\namplified by the primers. Four PCR reaction tubes were prepared, one for\neach cell extract and a forth as a no-template negative control. These\nwere loaded on to an electrophoresis gel along with a 100 base pair DNA\nmarker ladder\n\n![Primers specific to *Lactobacillus acidophilus* were designed and and\nused in a PCR reaction to confirm the identity of the bacteria isolated\nfrom probiotic capsules. *E.coli* was used as a negative control.
