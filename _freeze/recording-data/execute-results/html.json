Tidy data is a concept that was introduced by Hadley\nWickham in his paper Tidy Data [@Wickham2014-nl]. The paper is available\nonline at <http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf>.\n\nTidy data:\n\n-   Each variable should be in one column.\n-   Each different observation of that variable should be in a different\n    row.\n-   There should be one table for each \"kind\" of data.\n-   If you have multiple tables, they should include a column in the\n    table that allows them to be linked.\n\nThese concepts have been around for a long time and underlie formats\nenforced in several statistical packages such as SPSS, minitab and SAS.\n\nRecognising the structure of your data and organising it in tidy format\nis one of the most important step in data analysis.\n\n## Organising data in spreadsheets\n\nChecklist based on this excellent paper: \"Data Organization in Spreadsheets\" by \nKarl W. Broman and Kara H. Woo [@broman2018].\n\n1. Be consistent: \n   -   Use consistent codes for categorical variables.\n   -   Use a consistent fixed code for any missing values.\n   -   Use consistent variable names.\n   -   Use consistent subject identifiers.\n   -   Use a consistent data layout in multiple files\n   -   Use consistent file names.\n   -   Use a consistent format for all dates preferably with the standard \n       format YYYY-MM-DD\n   -   Be careful about extra spaces within cells\n   \n2. Choose good names:\n   -   make them short, but meaningful\n   -   do not use spaces, either in variable names or file names. Where you \n       might use spaces, use underscores or hyphens.\n   -   avoid special characters in names.\n   -   stick to lower case\n\n3. Do not have empty  or merged cells:\n   -   use a consistent code for missing values, such as NA.\n   -   ensure data is upper most, left most in a spreadsheet.\n   -   do not have column names over multiple rows - organise in tidy format\n       instead.\n\n4. Make it one rectangle or a collection of rectangles\n\n5. Do not have calculations in raw data files\n\n6. Do not use colour to convey meaning:\n   -   use text to convey meaning, such as \"yes\" or \"no\" rather than using \n       colour to indicate a yes or no.\n   -   do not use colour to indicate missing values, use a consistent code \n       such as NA.\n7. When recording data, consider using data validation to avoid errors and \n   prevent inconsistent data entry.",
