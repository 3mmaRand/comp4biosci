This page is a draft but is mainly complete should be readable.\n:::\n\nThe first steps into analysing data with R. The first chapter in this\npart covers important concepts about data: whether they are discrete and\ncontinuous and how we summarise them using descriptive statistics. These\nideas are not specific to analysing data with R, they apply whatever\nanalysis tool you use. \n\nThe second chapter introduces you to R and\nRStudio for the first time. It explains what R, RStudio and R packages\nare and where to find them. It then explores the layout and appearance.\n\nIn the third chapter you will start coding and lean the most common data\ntypes and data structures used for data analysis. \n\nThe fourth chapter describes some useful workflow patterns and tools for \norganising your work in RStudio. Using these will make learning R easier.\n\nFinally, we will go through a complete workflow from importing data from a \nfile to saving a figure for reporting.\n",
