Experimental Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Three cell types were used in the qPCR analysis: LT-HSCs, MPPs representing 
HSPCs, and total progenitors. Progenitors and MPPs contained four biological
replicates, each performed in triplicate, with LT-HSCs having three biological 
replicates, also performed in triplicate. Samples were run for 40 cycles using 
a StepOnePlus qPCR machine (Thermofisher). A housekeeping gene Hprt was used for
the quantification.

Analysis Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CT values were extracted using Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus software 
(Thermofisher) for Hprt and Fcgrt for each technical replicate. Mean CT value 
was next calculated for each biological replicate.

  - Each Hprt CT value was subtracted from its corresponding Fcgrt CT values to
    give delta CT for each biological replicate.
    
  - The DeltaDeltaCT value was then calculated by 2^-CT which was taken as 
    relative abundance of Fcgrt.

  -This analysis is coded for in "processed qPCR data.csv" The resulting 
   abundance is then written to a .csv file which is named "qPCR_Results.csv" 
   and is read into r as "qpcr_results".
