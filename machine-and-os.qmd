## Computer or tablet?

Computers (laptop or desktop) and tablets can both be useful for doing a
science degree but if you have to choose just one, I would recommend a
computer. This is because

1.  Computers typically offer more processing power, storage capacity,
    and flexibility for running complex software all of which are
    important in science.

2.  Scientific and academic software often cannot be installed on
    tablets - at least not easily.

3.  Your institution most likely has a networked computer system with
    computers that you use in taught workshop and which are available to
    you throughout your degree. Many people find it easier to use a
    similar computer at home so they can follow instructions from the
    workshop exactly to continue the work at home

4.  We often need to multitask and use several programs at once. The
    greater power and screen size of a computer usually makes this
    easier.

Tablets are more portable and have touch-screens and stylus support and
this makes them easier to use for note taking in lectures and annotating
documents. Some laptops also have touch-screens but they can be
expensive. Overtime computers will adopt more of the advantages of
tablets and tablets will adopt more of the advantages of computers.

## What is an operating system?

Every computer or mobile device has an operating system (OS) which
controls how all the other software on a computer interacts with the
computer hardware. You may already have a preference for a particular
OS. An OS starts up the computer, manages the memory and all the
processes, and controls all the devices connected to the computer. As a
consequence, all the other software on a computer has to be able to work
with the operating system installed.

Most people do not install the operating system but buy their machine
with it pre-installed.

## Types of operating system

### Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS

Windows and Mac are the two most widely used OS on personal computers.
Windows is developed by Microsoft and licensed to a multitude of PC
manufacturers, which accounts for its ubiquity on desktops and laptops
from Dell to Lenovo.

By contrast, macOS is proprietary software that runs exclusively on
Apple’s own hardware. The tight integration across Apple’s ecosystem
means that features "just work" when you switch between your Mac,
iPhone, and iPad.

You might already have had - or seen - a Mac versus Windows debate but
in reality it is down to preference for most users. If you already have
experience with one, you will probably prefer to keep using it but if
you are buying for the first time, I recommend using the same as your
institution uses. This makes it more likely that instructions for taught
material will just work on your machine and more likely that people
around you will be able to help.

One difference between Windows and Mac machines most noticed by users is
the different names for some useful keys. Table @tbl-key-board gives
some of these.

| Windows key | macOS key   |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enter       | Return      |
| Ctrl        | ⌘ (Command) |
| Alt         | ⌥ (Option)  |

When using RStudio, the section [@sec-keyboard-shortcuts-tips] on Keyboard Shortcuts should help you translate between the two if needed.

### Linux

Linux offers a very different philosophy: it is not a single OS but a
family of open‑source systems built around the Linux kernel, which Linus
Torvalds first released in 1991. Anyone may inspect, modify, or
redistribute the source code under licenses such as the GNU General
Public License. Linux is often used for high-performance and scientific
computing where workflows are script- rather than menu-driven and the
user interacts with the system through a command line.
