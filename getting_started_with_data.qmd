In the first part of this book you learnt some foundational ideas about working with computers. Now you are ready to take your first steps into analysing data with R. The first chapter in this part covers important concepts about data: whether they are discrete and continuous and how we summarise them. The second chapter introduces you to R and RStudio for the first time. We start by exploring the layout and appearance then move on to coding. The third chapter describes some useful workflow patterns and tools for organising your work in RStudio. Using these will make learning R easier. Finally, we will go through a complete workflow from importing data from a file to saving a figure for reporting.
