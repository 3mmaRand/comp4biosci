link between statistical testing and confidence intervals

Introduction to statistical models, what is a statistical model, what is a linear model. what is parametric? what are the assumptions and how do we check them.

## Approach of this section

This section covers regression, *t*-tests and one-way ANOVA which are special cases of a much more widely applicable statistical model known as the “general linear model.” It is common for *t*-tests and ANOVA to be taught using the `t.test()` and `aov()` functions in R respectively. Here we teach them using the `lm()` function. This is to emphasise that regression, *t*-tests and one-way ANOVA are all the same model, the General Linear Model, and to allow you to became familiar with the language and terminology of statistics.  The output of `lm()` is typical of statistical modelling functions in R general and you will find it easier to build on your understanding if you are familiar with the output of `lm()` 




what is non-parametric

single linear regression

linear model with one categorical explanatory variable with two groups also known as a two sample t-test


linear model with one categorical explanatory variable with three groups also known as a one-way anova

linear model with two categorical explanatory variables also known as two-way anova


non-parametric equivalents: the Wilcoxon and the Kruskal-Wallis

chi-squared goodness of fit tests

tests of association: chi-squared tests of association, correlation parametric and non-parametric
