A file is a unit of storage on a computer with a name that uniquely identifies it. Files can be of different types depending on the sort of information held in them. The file name very often consists of two parts, separated by a dot:

-   name - the base name of the file

-   extension that should indicate the format or content of the file.

Some examples are report.doc, analysis.R, culture.csv and readme.txt. The relationship between the file extension and the file type

One of the simplest types of file is a "text file" which contains text characters without formatting such as bold or italics and no images or colours. Plain text files can be opened in any text editor like Windows Notepad or Mac's TextEdit.
