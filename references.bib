  abstract = {The stuff you need to know about R, besides statistical analysis. The initial impetus for creating these materials is a two-day hands-on workshop. The target learner: Has a moderate amount of R and RStudio experience. Is largely self-taught. Suspects they have drifted into some idiosyncratic habits that may slow them down or make their work products more brittle. Is interested in (re)designing their R lifestyle, to be more effective and more self-sufficient. The in-person workshops are still the primary delivery method for this content, but we've begun recording prose versions of this content, in order to make it more widely available and for participants to refer back to. Warning: these materials absolutely do not constitute a self-contained ``book'', nor do they capture all workshop content. We focus on building holistic and project-oriented workflows that address the most common sources of friction in data analysis, outside of doing the statistical analysis itself.}

@ARTICLE{Wickham2014-nl,
  title    = "Tidy Data",
  author   = "Wickham, Hadley",
  abstract = "A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready
              for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make
              data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper
              tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data
              tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and
              visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a
              column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational
              unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy
              datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal
              with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes
              it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that
              both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a
              consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated
              with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.",
