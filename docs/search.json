But for many, this fluency is with using tablets and smart phones and these are different to computers. Several studies have shown that the increased reliance on of tablets and smartphones makes people highly proficient at online communication but hampers the development of other computing skills Drossel and Eickelmann (2017); Australian Curriculum and Authority (2015).\nThis chapter tries to teach the computer skills that you might have missed if you have used mainly the mobile devices. I focus on the knowledge gaps that often appear when people are computational data analysis. Primarily these are to do with organising and files and folders in the file systems, installing software and trouble shooting.\nNot everyone will need to read all of this section. If you often use a computer for tasks like organising files and writing documents and spreadsheets much of this chapter might be familiar. However, if you have mainly used your mobile phone and tablets to access the internet then reading all of it will be helpful.\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Curriculum, Assessment, and Reporting Authority. 2015. ‚ÄúNational Assessment Program ICT Literacy.‚Äù https://nap.edu.au/_resources/D15_8761__NAP-ICT_2014_Public_Report_Final.pdf.\n\n\nDrossel, Kerstin, and Birgit Eickelmann. 2017. ‚ÄúThe Use of Tablets in Secondary Schools and Its Relationship with Computer Literacy.‚Äù In, 114‚Äì24.

This is because\n\nComputers typically offer more processing power, storage capacity, and flexibility for running complex software all of which are important in science.\nScientific and academic software often cannot be installed on tablets - at least not easily.\nYour institution most likely has a networked computer system with computers that you use in taught workshop and which are available to you throughout your degree. Many people find it easier to use a similar computer at home so they can follow instructions from the workshop exactly to continue the work at home\nWe often need to multitask and use several programs at once. The greater power and screen size of a computer usually makes this easier.\n\nTablets are more portable and have touch-screens and stylus support and this makes them easier to use for note taking in lectures and annotating documents. Some laptops also have touch-screens but they can be expensive. Overtime computers will adopt more of the advantages of tablets and tablets will adopt more of the advantages of computers."

Instead our journey begins in the so called ‚Äúhome directory‚Äù. You home directory is not usually named home but with your username for that computer. Your personal files and directories can be found inside this folder. This is where your computer assumes you want to start when you open your file manager. On Windows and Mac your home directory is a directory inside the directory called Users immediately under the root and named with your username (Figure¬†3.5).\n\n\nFigure¬†3.5: The hierarchy from the root. The top level is C:\\ in Windows and / in Mac. Below that is the Users directory which has a folder for each user. Your home directory is named with your username inside the Users folder\n\nThere will be other folders immediately below the root directory (on the same level of the hierarchy as Users).

    "text": "5.2 Distributions\nAny variable has a distribution which describes the values the variable can take and the chance of them occurring. The distribution is a function (relationship) which captures how the values are mapped to the probability of them occurring. A distribution has a general type, given by the function and is further tuned by the parameters in the function. For example variables like height, length, concentration, mass and intensity follow a normal distribution also know as the bell-shaped curve so that they look similar. However, they have different means and standard deviations. The mean and the standard deviation are the parameters of the normal distribution.\nAn important distinction is between discrete and continuous types of data. Continuous variables are measurements that can take any value in their range. Discrete variables can take only specific values.\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5.1: A continuous variable has a smooth distribution and the probability of getting a particular value or less is given by the area under the curve. The example is a normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5.2: A discrete variable has a stepped distribution and the probability of getting exactly a particular is given by the area of the bar at that value. The example is a Poisson distribtion.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.1 Discrete data\nDiscrete variables can take only specific values and can be categories, like genotype, or counts, like the number of petals.\n\n5.2.1.1 Categories: Nominal and Ordinal\nCategorical data can be nominal and ordinal depending on whether they are ordered. Nominal variable have no particular order, for example, the eye colour of Drosophila or the species of bird. When summarising data on bird species, it wouldn‚Äôt matter in what order the information was given or plotted. Ordinal variables have an order. The Likert scale Likert (1932) used in questionnaires is one example. The possible responses are Strongly agree, Agree, Disagree and Strongly disagree; these have an order that you would use when plotting them (Figure¬†5.3).\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5.3: The categories of bird species are unordered - or nominal - but those in a likert variable are ordinal.\n\n\n\nThe most appropriate way to summarise nominal or ordinal data is to report the most frequent values or tabulate the number of each value (Table¬†5.1).\n\n\n\n\nTable¬†5.1: Frequency of reposnes.\n\nResponse\nFrequency\n\n\n\nStrongly agree\n15\n\n\nAgree\n18\n\n\nDisagree\n10\n\n\nStrongly disagree\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.1.2 Counts\nCounts are one of the most common data types. They are quantitative but discrete because they can take only specific values. Counts tend to follow a distribution called the Poisson distribution meaning that there is an expected number of zeros, ones and twos etc that appear. This is true no matter what you count. The distribution of counts is not symmetrical and has a tail to the right - especially for lower count ranges.\nA mean and standard deviation are not usually the best way to summarise a count variable because their distribution is not symmetrical. Figure¬†5.4 shows the number of groundsel plants in a hundred 1 metre square quadrats[^ideas_about_data-1]. [^ideas_about_data-1]: A¬†quadrat¬†is a frame used in¬†ecology¬†to outline a standard unit of area for study of the distribution of plant species over a wider are. Typically, quadrats are placed randomly over the area and the number of individuals in each quadrat is recorded.\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5.4: Counts are discrete. They often follow a Poisson distribution.\n\n\n\nThe mean of 0.73 groundsel plants per quadrat does not really reflect that the majority of quadrats contained no plants. The average is being dragged up by the few quadrats containing 3 plants.\nFor count variables - and other variables that are not symmetrical - it is often better to give the median and interquartile range.\nThe median is the middle value when the values are arranged in order. The interquartile range (IQR) indicates the spread in the data. The lower quartile is half way between the lowest value and the middle value and the upper quartile is half way between the middle value and the highest value.\n\n5.2.2 Continuous data\nContinuous variables are measurements that can take any value in their range so there are an infinite number of possible values. The values have decimal places. Variables like the length and mass of an organism, the volume and optical density of a solution, or the colour intensity of an image are continuous. Many response variables are continuous but continuous variables can also be explanatory. For example,\n\n5.2.3 The normal distribution\nProperties of normal distributions\nFor example, a variable like human height has values with decimal places which follow a normal distribution also known as the Gaussian distribution or the bell-shaped curve. Values of 1.65 metres occur more often than values of 2 metres and values of 3 metres never occur (Figure¬†5.5).\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5.5: Human height follows a normal distribution."

    "text": "5.3 Theory and practice\nThe distinction between continuous and discrete values is clear in theory but in practice, the actual values you have may differ from the expected distribution for a particular variable. For example, we would expect the mass of cats to be continuous because any value in the range is possible. However, if our scales only measure to the nearest kilogram, then the values become discrete because the only the values possible are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. The gap between values, 1kg, is big compared to the range of values we expect (Figure¬†5.6)\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5.6: The mass of cats in kilograms is theoretically continuous (left). If we measure only to the nearest kilogram, mass becomes discrete because 1kg covers a large chunk of the range (right).\n\n\n\nIn contrast, the number of hairs on a human head ranges from about 80,000 to 150,000 so the difference between having 100,203 hairs and 100,204 hairs is so tiny the variable is practically continuous (Figure¬†5.7).\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5.7: The number of hairs on a human head discrete. But one increment is a tiny proportion of the range of values so the number of hairs is practically continuous.\n\n\n\nA rule of thumb is that if the mean count is above about 100, then the distribution of counts closely matches the normal distribution."

Data is commonly organised with variables in columns and observations in rows.\nRoles of Variables in Analysis: Variables in research can be independent or explanatory variables (chosen or set by researchers) and dependent or response variables (measured by researchers).\nDistributions: A variable‚Äôs distribution describes the types of values it can take and the likelihood of each value occurring. Variables can be classified as discrete (specific values) or continuous (any value within a range). The shape of a distribution is determined by parameters.\nDiscrete Data: Discrete variables can be categories (e.g., genotype) or counts (e.g., the number of petals). Categorical data can be nominal (no order) or ordinal (ordered, like a Likert scale).\nContinuous Data: Continuous variables can take any value within a range. Examples include measurements like length, mass, volume, and optical density. Human height is often modelled by a normal distribution.\nTheory and Practice: While the theoretical distinction between continuous and discrete values is clear, the actual values obtained in practice may deviate from the expected distribution. Measurement precision and range affect whether a variable is considered continuous or discrete. A rule of thumb suggests that if the mean count is above approximately 100, the distribution of counts approximates a normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nLikert, R. 1932. ‚ÄúA Technique for the Measurement of Attitudes.‚Äù Archives of Psychology 22 140: 55‚Äì55."

It is widely used in industry and academia. It is what is known as a ‚Äúdomain-specific‚Äù language meaning that it is designed especially for doing data analysis and visualisation rather than a ‚Äúgeneral-purpose‚Äù programming language like Python and C++. It makes doing the sorts of things that bioscientists do a bit easier than in a general purpose-language.\n\n6.1.2 What is RStudio?\nRStudio is what is known as an ‚Äúintegrated development environment‚Äù (IDE) for R made by Posit. IDEs have features that make it easier to do coding like syntax highlighting, code completion and viewers for files, code objects, packages and plots. You don‚Äôt have to use RStudio to use R but it is very helpful.\n\n6.1.3 Why is it better to use R than Excel, googlesheets or some other spreadsheet program?\nSpreadsheet programs are not statistical packages so although you can carry out some analysis tasks in them they are limited, get things wrong (known about since 1994) and teach you bad data habits. Spreadsheets encourage you to do things that are going to make analysis difficult.\n\n6.1.4 Why is it better to use R than SPSS, Minitab or some other menu-driven statistics program?\n\nR is free and open source which it will always be available to you .\nCarrying out data analysis using coding makes everything you do reproducible\nThe skills and expertise you gain through learning R are highly transferable ‚Äì much more so than those acquired using SPSS.\nSee Thomas Mock‚Äôs demonstration of doing some data analysis in R including ‚ÄúThe Kick Ass Curve‚Äù: https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/a-gentle-introduction-to-tidy-statistics-in-r/\n\nThere are other good options such as Julia and Python and you are encouraged to explore these. We chose R in part because of the R community which is one of R‚Äôs greatest assets, being vibrant, inclusive and supportive of users at all levels. https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/06/23/community/"

    "text": "6.4 Introduction to RStudio\nIn this section we will introduce you to working in RStudio. We will explain the windows that you see when you first open RStudio and how to change its appearance to suit you. Then we will see how we use R as a calculator and how assign values to R objects.\n\n6.4.1 Changing the appearance\nWhen you first open RStudio it will display three panes and have a white background Figure¬†6.1\n\n\nFigure¬†6.1: When you first open RStudio it will be white with three panes\n\nWe will talk more about these three panes soon but first, let‚Äôs get into character - the character of a programmer! You might have noticed that people comfortable around computers are often using dark backgrounds. A dark background reduces eye strain and often makes ‚Äúcode syntax‚Äù more obvious making it faster to learn and understand at a glance. Code syntax is the set of rules that define what the various combinations of symbols mean. It takes time to learn these rules and you will learn best by repeated exposure to writing, reading and copying code. You have done this before when you learned your first spoken language. All languages have syntax rules governing the order of words and we rarely think about these consciously, instead relying on what sounds and looks right. And what sounds and looks right grows out repeated exposure. For example, 35% of languages, including English, Chinese, Yoruba and Polish use the Subject-Verb-Object syntax rule:\n\nEnglish: Emma likes R\nChinese: ËâæÁéõÂñúÊ¨¢R Emma x«êhuƒÅn R\nYoruba: Emma f·∫πran R\nPolish: Emma lubi R\n\nand 40% use Subject-Object-Verb including Turkish and Korean\n\nTurkish: Emma R‚Äôyi seviyor\nKorean: Ïó†ÎßàÎäî RÏùÑ Ï¢ãÏïÑÌïúÎã§ emmaneun Reul joh-ahanda\n\nYou learned this rule in your language very early, long before you were conscious of it, just by being exposed to it frequently. In this book I try to tell you the syntax rules, but you will learn most from looking at, and copying code. Because of this, it is well worth tinkering with the appearance of RStudio to see what Editor theme makes code elements most obvious to you.\nThere is a tool bar at the top of RStudio. Choose the Tools option and then Global options. This will open a window where many options can be changed Figure¬†6.2.\n\n\nFigure¬†6.2: Tools | Global Options opens a window. One of the options is Appearance\n\nGo to the Appearance Options and choose and Editor theme you like, followed by OK.\nThe default theme is Textmate. You will notice that all the Editor themes have syntax highlighting so that keywords, variable names, operators, etc are coloured but some themes have stronger contrasts than others. For beginners, I recommend Vibrant Ink, Chaos or Merbivore rather than Dreamweaver or Gob which have little contrast between some elements. However, individuals differ so experiment for yourself. I tend to vary between Solarised light and dark.\nYou can also turn one Screen Reader Support in the Accessibility Options in Tools | Global Options.\nBack to the Panes. You should be looking at three windows: One on the left and two on the right1.\nThe window on the left, labelled Console, is where R commands are executed. In a moment we will start by typing commands in this window. Over on the right hand side, at the top, have several tabs, with the Environment tab showing. This is where all the objects and data that you create will be listed. Behind the Environment tab is the History and later you will be able to view this to see a history of all your commands.\nOn the bottom right hand side, we have a tab called Plots which is where your plots will go, a tab called Files which is a file explorer just like Windows Explorer or Mac Finder, and a Packages tab where you can see all the packages that are installed. The Packages tab also provides a way to install additional packages. The Help tab has access to all the manual pages.\nRight, let‚Äôs start coding!\n\n6.4.2 Your first piece of code\nWe can use R just like a calculator. Put your cursor after the &gt; in the Console, type 3 + 4 and ‚Üµ Enter to send that command:\n\n3+4\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nThe &gt; is called the ‚Äúprompt‚Äù. You do not have to type it, it tells you that R is ready for input.\nWhere I‚Äôve written 3+4, I have no spaces. However, you can have spaces, and in fact, it‚Äôs good practice to use spaces around your operators because it makes your code easier to read. So a better way of writing this would be:\n\n3 + 4\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nIn the output we have the number 7, which, obviously, is the answer. From now on, you should assume commands typed at the console should be followed by ‚Üµ Enter to send them.\nThe one in parentheses, [1], is an index. It is telling you that the 7 is the first element of the output. We can see this more clear if we create something with more output. For example, 50:100 will print the numbers from 50 to 100.\n\n50:100\n\n [1]  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68\n[20]  69  70  71  72  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87\n[39]  88  89  90  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99 100\n\n\nThe numbers in the square parentheses at the beginning of the line give you the index of the first element in the line. R is telling you where you are in the output.\n\n6.4.3 Assigning variables\nVery often we want to keep input values or output for future use. We do this with ‚Äòassignment‚Äô An assignment is a statement in programming that is used to set a value to a variable name. In R, the operator used to do assignment is &lt;-. It assigns the value on the right-hand to the value on the left-hand side.\nTo assign the value 3 to x we do:\n\nx &lt;- 3\n\nand ‚Üµ Enter to send that command.\nThe assignment operator is made of two characters, the &lt; and the - and there is a keyboard short cut: Alt+- (windows) or Option+- (Mac). Using the shortcut means you‚Äôll automatically get spaces. You won‚Äôt see any output when the command has been executed because there is no output. However, you will see x listed under Values in the Environment tab (top right).\nYour turn! Assign the value of 4 to a variable called y:\n\nCodey &lt;- 4\n\n\nCheck you can see y listed in the Environment tab.\nType x and ‚Üµ Enter to print the contents of x in the console:\n\nx\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nWe can use these values in calculations just like we could in in maths and algebra.\n\nx + y\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nWe get the output of 7 just as we expect. Suppose we make a mistake when typing, for example, accidentally pressing the u button instead of the y button:\n\nx + u\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'u' not found\n\n\nWe get an error. We will probably see this error quite often - it means we have tried to use a variable that is not in our Environment. So when you get that error, have a quick look up at your environment2.\nWe made a typo and will want to try again. We usefully have access to all the commands that previously entered when we use the ‚Üë Up Arrow. This is known as command recall. Pressing the ‚Üë Up Arrow once recalls the last command; pressing it twice recalls the command before the last one and so on.\nRecall the x + u command (you may need to use the ‚Üì Down Arrow to get back to get it) and use the Back space key to remove the u and then add a y.\nA lot of what we type is going to be wrong - that is not because you are a beginner, it is same for everybody! On the whole, you type it wrong until you get it right and then you move to the next part. This means you are going to have to access your previous commands often. The History - behind the Environment tab - contains everything you can see with the ‚Üë Up Arrow. You can imagine that as you increase the number of commands you run in a session, having access the this record of everything you did is useful. However, the thing about the history is, that it has everything you typed, including all the wrong things!\nWhat we really want is a record of everything we did that was right! This is why we use scripts instead of typing directly into the console.\n\n6.4.4 Using Scripts\nAn R script is a plain text file with a .R extension and containing R code. Instead of typing into the console, we normally type into a script and then send the commands to the console when we are ready to run them. Then if we‚Äôve made any mistakes, we just correct our script and by the end of the session, it contains a record of everything we typed that worked.\nYou have several options open a new script:\n\nbutton: Green circle with a white cross, top left and choose R Script\nmenu: File | New File | R Script\nkeyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+N (Windows) / Shift+Command+N (Mac)\n\nOpen a script and add the two assignments to it:\n\nx &lt;- 3\ny &lt;- 4\n\nTo send the first line to the console, we place our cursor on the line (anywhere) and press Ctrl-Enter (Windows) / Command-Return. That line will be executed in the console and in the script, our cursor will jump to the next line. Now, send the second command to the console in the same way.\nFrom this point forward, you should assume commands should be typed into the script and sent to the console.\nAdd the incorrect command attempting to sum the two variables:\n\nx + u\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'u' not found\n\n\nTo correct this, we do not add another line to the script but instead edit the existing command:\n\nx + y\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nIn addition to making it easy to keep a record of your work, scripts have another big advantage, you can include ‚Äòcomments‚Äô - pieces of text that describe what the code is doing. Comments are indicated with a # in front of them. You can write anything you like after a # and R will recognise that it is not code and doesn‚Äôt need to be run.\n\n# This script performs the sum of two values\n\nx &lt;- 3    # can be altered\ny &lt;- 4    # can be altered\n\n# perform sum\nx + y\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nThe comments should be highlighted in a different colour than the code. They will be italic in some Editor themes.\nYou have several options save a script:\n\nbutton: use the floppy disc icon\nmenu: File | Save\nkeyboard shortcut: Ctrl+S (Windows) / Command+S (Mac)\n\nYou could use a name like test1.R - note the .R extension wil be added automatically.\n\n6.4.5 Other types of file in RStudio\n\n\n.R script code but not the objects. You always want to save this\n\n.Rdata also known as the workspace or session, the objects, but not the code. You usually do not want to save this. Some exceptions e.g., if it takes quite a long time to run the commands.\ntext files\n\nI recommend changing some of the default settings to make your life a little easier. Go back into the Global Options window with Tools | Global Options. The top tab is General Figure¬†6.3.\n\n\nFigure¬†6.3: Tools | Global Options opens a window. One of the options is General. This where you can change the default behaviour of RStudio. Highlighted is the default (start up) directory and the option to Save and Restore the workspace.\n\nFirst, we will set our default working directory. Under ‚ÄòDefault working directory (when not in a project3):‚Äô click Browse and navigate to a through your file system to a folder where you want to work. You may want to create a folder specifically for studying this book.\nSecond, we will change the Workspace options. Turn off ‚ÄòRestore .RData into workspace at startup‚Äô and change ‚ÄòSave workspace to .RData on exit‚Äô to ‚ÄòNever‚Äô. These options mean R will start up clean each time."

    "text": "6.6 Data types and structures in R\nIn this section, we are going to introduce you to some of R‚Äôs data types and structures. We won‚Äôt be covering all of them now, just those you are going to use often in this part of the book. These are numerics (numbers), characters, ‚Äòlogicals‚Äô, vectors and dataframes. We can do a lot with just these. We will also cover using functions.\nWe are going to consider\n\ntypes of value also known as data types\nfunctions\ndata structures\n\n\n6.6.1 Data types\nThis refers to the type of value that something is. They might be numerics or characters or ‚Äòlogical‚Äô (either true of false). We assign a number, like the value of 23 to a variable called x like this:\n\nx &lt;- 23\nx\n\n[1] 23\n\n\nWe do not need to use quotes for numbers but we do need to use them for characters and can assign the word banana to the variable a like this:\n\na &lt;- \"banana\"\na\n\n[1] \"banana\"\n\n\nQuotes are needed because otherwise R wouldn‚Äôt know whether you were referring to a value or a existing object called banana. This is also why you can‚Äôt have variable name like 14 - R would not be able to tell the difference between the number 14 and an object named 14 since numbers and objects don‚Äôt need quotes.\nAnything composed of non-numeric characters, including single characters, need to have quotes around it. You can even force a number to be a character by putting quotes around it:\n\nb &lt;- \"23\"\nb\n\n[1] \"23\"\n\n\nNotice that things inside quotes appear in a different colour (the colour will depend on the Editor theme you choose). This will help you identify when you have forgotten some closing quotes5:\n\na &lt;- \"banana\nx &lt;- 23\n\nAlthough the data type is ‚Äòcharacter‚Äô we often use the term ‚Äòstring‚Äô for collections - strings - of characters\nWe also have special values called ‚Äòlogicals‚Äô which take a value of either TRUE or FALSE.\n\nc &lt;- TRUE\nc\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nAlthough TRUE is a word, R recognises it as special word. It appears in a different colour and no quotes are needed. This is the same for FALSE.\n\nc &lt;- FALSE\nc\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nAs you type FALSE, the colour changes as it recognises the special word FALSE. Try to pay attention to the editor theme‚Äôs colouring - it is trying to help you!\n\n6.6.2 Functions\nThe aim of this section is to help you understand the logic of using a function. Functions have a name and then a set of parentheses. The function name minimally explains what the function does. Inside the parentheses are ‚Äòarguments‚Äô - the pieces of information you give to the function. When coding, we often talk about passing arguments to functions and calling functions. A simple function call looks like this:\nfunction_name(argument)\nA function can take zero to many arguments. Where you give several arguments, they are separated by commas:\nfunction_name(argument1, argument2, argument3, ...)\nThe first function you are going to use is str() which gives the structure of an object:\n\nstr(x)\n\n num 23\n\n\nIt‚Äôs telling me that x is a number and contains 23.\nYour turn! Use str() on b:\n\nCodestr(b)\n\n chr \"23\"\n\n\nstr() is a function I use a lot to check what sort of R object I have.\nWe must give str() at least one argument, the object we want the structure of, but additional arguments are also possible. Later we will discover how to find out and use a function‚Äôs arguments.\nSo far we our objects have consisted of a single thing but usually we have several bits of data that we want to collect together into a data structure.\n\n6.6.3 Data structures: vectors\nImagine we have the ages of six people. Since all the numbers are ages, we would want to keep them together. The minimal data structure is called a vector. We can create a vector, which collects together several numbers using a function, c(). This is one of only a few functions in R with a single-letter name. Because it has a single letter, sometimes people get confused about it but we can tell it is a function because it has a set of parentheses.\nTo create a vector called ages of several numbers we use\n\nages &lt;- c(23, 42, 7, 9, 54, 12)\n\nType ages and run if you want to print the contents to the console:\n\nages\n\n[1] 23 42  7  9 54 12\n\n\nUsing str() on ages\n\nstr(ages)\n\n num [1:6] 23 42 7 9 54 12\n\n\ntells us we have numbers with the indices of 1 to 6.\nWe can also create a vector of strings. Suppose we have names to go with the ages.\n\nnames &lt;- c(\"Rowan\", \"Aang\", \"Zain\", \"Charlie\", \"Jules\", \"Efe\")\n\nRStudio has a super useful feature for putting items in quotes, brackets or parentheses if you initially forget them: If you select something and type the opening element, that thing will be surrounded rather than over written. For example, if you had written:\n\nnames &lt;- Rowan, Aang, Zain, Charlie, Jules, Efe\n\nSelect one of the names and then type an opening quote - you should see the name is then surrounded by quotes rather than overwritten. You can repeat this process for all the names (note that double clicking on the name will select it). Selecting the whole list and typing an opening parenthesis will put the whole list in parentheses. This is a feature you get to love so much and use so often that other programs will annoy you when you overwrite something you meant to quote!\nSo we can also have vectors of logical values. For example, we might have a vector that indicates that Rowan, Aang and Charlie like chocolate, but Zain, Jules and Efe do not:\n\nchocolate &lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)\n\nRemember, because TRUE and FALSE are special words so we do not need quote them.\n\n6.6.4 Indexing vectors\nYou might be wondering how to get a single element out of a vector if typing the vector‚Äôs name prints the entire vector. This is by ‚Äòindexing‚Äô. An index is a number from 16 to the length of a vector which gives the position in the vector and is denoted by square brackets. For example, to pull out the second element of ages:\n\nages[2]\n\n[1] 42\n\n\nYour turn! Print the last element of names:\n\nCodenames[6]\n\n[1] \"Efe\"\n\n\nWe an extract more than one element by giving more than one index. If the indices are adjacent like 3rd, 4th and 5th, we have use the colon:\n\nnames[3:5]\n\n[1] \"Zain\"    \"Charlie\" \"Jules\"  \n\n\nIf the indices are not adjacent, like 2 and 6 with need to combine them with c():\n\nnames[c(2, 6)]\n\n[1] \"Aang\" \"Efe\" \n\n\nWe can also use a logical vector to extract elements. Suppose you want to extract the names and ages of the people who like chocolate:\n\nnames[chocolate]\n\n[1] \"Rowan\"   \"Aang\"    \"Charlie\"\n\nages[chocolate]\n\n[1] 23 42  9\n\n\nAt each of the indices in chocolate that contain TRUE, the name and age are returned.\n\n6.6.5 Changing the defaults for a function\nThe functions we have used so far, c() and str() have worked without us having to change default behaviour. For example, if we want to calculate the mean age of our people we can use the mean() function in default form:\n\nmean(ages)\n\n[1] 24.5\n\n\nImagine Charlie would like their age removed from the dataset or that we never knew their age. We would not want a vector containing just five elements because the ages would not match the people in the same position in the vector. Instead, we would have a missing value at that position. Missing values are NA (not applicable) in R and NA is another special word, like TRUE and FALSE, that doesn‚Äôt need quotes. We can set Charlie‚Äôs age to NA using indexing:\n\nages[names == \"Charlie\"] &lt;- NA\nages\n\n[1] 23 42  7 NA 54 12\n\n\nThe == means ‚Äúis equal to‚Äù and the result of names == \"Charlie\" is a vector of logicals: FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE. This means ages[names == \"Charlie\"] references the age in ages at the index of Charlie in names\nIf we now try to calculate the mean age:\n\nmean(ages)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nWe get an NA! What we really want is an average of the ages we do have. The mean() function has an argument that allows you to cope with that situation called na.rm. By default, na.rm is set to FALSE but we can set it to TRUE using\n\nmean(ages, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 27.6\n\n\n\n6.6.6 Data structures: dataframes\nWe have three vectors, names, ages and chocolate which are all part of the same dataset. By far the most common way of organising data in R is within a ‚Äúdataframe‚Äù. A dataframe, has rows and columns: each column represents a variable and each row represents a case. To make a dataframe using our three vectors we use:\n\npeople &lt;- data.frame(names, ages, chocolate)\n\nYou will see people listed in the Global environment under Data. To open a spreadsheet-like view of the dataframe click its name in the Global Environment Figure¬†6.5\n\n\nFigure¬†6.5: To open a spreadsheet-like view of the dataframe click its name in the Global Environment"

    "text": "7.4 Understanding the pipe |&gt;\n\nThe pipe operator improves code readability by:\n\nstructuring sequences of data operations left-to-right and top to bottom rather than from inside and out),\nminimizing the need for intermediates,\nmaking it easy to add steps anywhere in the sequence of operations.\n\nFor example, suppose we want to apply a log-square root transformation which is sometimes applied to make a flat distribution more normal. There are two approaches we could use without the pipe: nesting the functions and creating an intermediate. We will consider both of these. First, let us generate a few numbers of work with:\n\n# generate some numbers\n# this will give me ten random numbers between 1 and 100\nnums &lt;- sample(1:100, size = 10)\n\nTo apply the transformation we can nest the functions so the output put of sqrt(nums) becomes the input of log():\n\n# apply a log-square root transformation\ntnums &lt;- log(sqrt(nums))\ntnums\n\n [1] 2.2821741 1.7328680 1.9560115 1.8920948 2.1783544 2.0554369 2.1170533\n [8] 0.6931472 0.8958797 2.2386684\n\n\nThe first function to be applied is innermost. When we are using just two functions, the level of nesting does not cause too much difficulty in reading the code. However, you can image this gets more unreadable as the number of functions applied increases. It also makes it harder to debug and find out where an error might be. One solution is to create intermediate variables so the commands a given in order:\n\n# apply a log-square root transformation\nsqrtnums &lt;- sqrt(nums)\ntnums &lt;- log(sqrtnums)\n\nUsing intermediates make your code easier to follow at first but clutters up your environment and code with variables you don‚Äôt care about. You also start of run out names!\nThe pipe is a more elegant and readable solution. It allows you to send the output of one operation as input to the next function. The pipe has long been used by Unix operating systems (where the pipe operator is |). The R pipe operator is |&gt;, a short cut for which is Ctrl+Shift+M.\nUsing the pipe, we can apply out transformation with:\n\ntnums &lt;- nums |&gt; \n  sqrt() |&gt; \n  log()\n\nThe command are in the order applied, there are no intermediates and the code is easier to debug and to build-up step-by-step..\nNote that |&gt; is the pipe that comes with base R which was only added in the last couple of years. Before it existed, **tidyverse** had a pipe operator provided by the *magrittr** package. The magrittr pipe is %&gt;%. In your googling, you may well see code written using the %&gt;%. In most cases, the pipes are interchangeable."
