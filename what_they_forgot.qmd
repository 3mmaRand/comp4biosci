## Why this part

Most students grew up with the presence of digital technology and are thought to be comfortable with, and fluent in, technology. But for many, this fluency is with using tablets and smart phones and these are different to computers. Several studies have shown that the increased reliance on of tablets and smartphones makes people highly proficient at online communication but hampers the development of other computing skills @drossel2017; @australiancurriculumassessmentandreportingNationalAssessmentProgram2014.

This chapter tries to teach the computer skills that you might have missed if you have used mainly the mobile devices. I focus on the knowledge gaps that often appear when people are computational data analysis. Primarily these are to do with organising and files and folders in the file systems, installing software and trouble shooting.

Not everyone will need to read all of this section. If you often use a computer for tasks like organising files and writing documents and spreadsheets much of this chapter might be familiar. However, if you have mainly used your mobile phone and tablets to access the internet then reading all of it will be helpful.
